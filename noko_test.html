      We couldn’t wait for official spring, but it’s “Springtime for Hitler” nonetheless. A has-been Broadway producer, Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel at his seediest best) has a great scheme he’ll bilk his investors out of dough by producing a surefire failure. Bialystock and his CPA Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) take on a goose-stepping tribute to Hitler, a musical no less, with spaced-out hippie Lorenzo St. DuBois, a.k.a. L.S.D. (Dick Shawn), as the Fu&#776;hrer “with a song in his heart.” For his first film, Mel Brooks had the good sense to lead with bad taste. This highly vulgar satire definitely stirred up a furor of its own.<br /> <br />&mdash;Steve Seid<br /> <br />&bull; Written by Brooks. Photographed by Joseph Coffey. With Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, Dick Shawn, Kenneth Mars. (88 mins, Color, 35mm, From Rialto Pictures)
