<p><i>"Ray has invariably preferred the intimate story to the grand epic, and is the poet par excellence of the human-scale, life-sized comedy or tragedy of ordinary men and women, journeying, as we all journey, down little, but unforgettable roads."—Salman Rushdie<br /></i><br />Before the “international art house circuit,” before “Third World Film,” before “slow cinema” and “rural realism,” there was Satyajit Ray, one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time. More than a decade has passed since Ray was honored with a retrospective, and in that time cinematic trends have made his work even more necessary to see again. <br /><br />Born in Calcutta in 1921 into a family of prominent Bengali intellectuals (Ray’s grandfather was a writer and publisher, while his father wrote children’s tales and satirical stories), Ray first worked in an advertising firm as a visual designer, creating covers for books and even film posters. Founding the Calcutta Film Society in 1947 fueled his desire to enter filmmaking, and in 1955 he debuted with <i>Pather Panchali</i>, part of his Apu trilogy. While this neorealist, rural-set trio of films launched Ray’s career (an infamous midnight screening at the Cannes Film Festival awakened the world to his talents), the great director seemed equally at home in a wide variety of genres and settings: period tales of urban elites, chamber pieces filled with music and song, documentaries on poets and artists, even children’s fables and detective stories. More than a filmmaker, he was also a composer, visual artist, intellectual, theorist, and even illustrator of children’s tales.<br /><br />“Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in a world without seeing the sun or the moon,” wrote Akira Kurosawa. Ray passed away in 1992, leaving behind a legacy of thirty-six films and countless short stories, sketches, illustrations, and even musical compositions. Our series, which continues through August, includes nearly all of his films. Discover—or rediscover—this legend of cinema.<i><br /></i><br />—Jason Sanders, Film Notes Writer<br /><br /><i>About the preservation&#8232;</i><b><br /></b>The Academy Film Archive’s Satyajit Ray Preservation Project is an ongoing effort to preserve and restore Ray’s entire filmography. It began in 1992, after the producers of the Oscar telecast, who were gathering clips for the presentation of Ray’s Honorary Award, discovered that there were very few prints or video masters of Ray’s films in the United States, and that they were incomplete and in poor condition. The Academy decided to create a catalog of the surviving elements of all Ray’s films to assess whether any were in danger of being lost. The final report was chilling and prompted resolute action.<br /><br />For its preservation efforts, the Academy has collaborated closely with the Satyajit Ray Society; a group of producers who worked with Ray; the National Archives of India; the Merchant and Ivory Foundation; the Film Foundation; and the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This teamwork has ensured that every element that still exists can be accessed to make the best restorations possible. To date, the Academy  Film Archive has preserved eighteen of Ray’s feature films and one short subject.</p>
